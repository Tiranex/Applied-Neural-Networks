# Project Overview

This project was done for a talk titled <b>"Introduction to Neural Networks"</b> in UCA, all the resource and models explained are avaliable in this repository. Furthermore, the presentation can be found [here](latex/nn-pde.pdf). The idea of this talk was to explain key concepts like: <em> activation functions, forward propagation, loss functions, training and testing... </em> in a simple way so anyone can understand the mathematical concepts behind them.

The talk was done by me on 14 March on the International Mathematics Day or Ï€ day.
